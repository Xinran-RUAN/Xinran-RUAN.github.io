Abstract: We propose an asymptotic preserving (A-P) scheme for a population model structured by age and a phenotypical trait with or without mutation. As shown in a paper by S. Nordmann, B. Perthame, and C. Taing, Dirac concentrations on particular phenotypical traits appear in the case without mutation, which makes the numerical resolution of the problem challenging. Inspired by its asymptotic behaviour, we apply a proper WKB representation of the solution to derive an A-P scheme, with which we can accurately capture the concentrations on a coarse, parameter-independent mesh. Important properties, including the A-P property, are rigorously proved. The scheme can be generalized to the case with mutation, where a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation will be involved in the limiting model. It can be formally shown that the generalized scheme is A-P as well.
