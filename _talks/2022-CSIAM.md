Abstract: Keller-Segel type models, which were originally proposed for pattern formation in bacterial populations, can be modified to be better consistent with biological systems. Taking into account the finite size of the cells and volume limitations in space leads to the so-called “volume-filling” Keller-Segel model, which prevents the finite time blow-up of solution.

In this talk, I will show how the individual mechanisms at the cell level can lead to volume-filling effects at the population level. A novel nonlinear kinetic ‘velocity jump’ model, which converges to the volume-filling Keller-Segel model in the diffusion limit, will be introduced. To numerically verify the consistency of the new model, an asymptotic preserving scheme, which is based on the macro-micro decomposition technique, will be proposed.
