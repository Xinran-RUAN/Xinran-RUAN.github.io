Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) has proven to be a big success in describing the Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC), where only the binary interaction approximated by the Fermi contact interaction is considered. However, in the case of higher particle densities, a modification of the model is necessary. One choice is to include a higher order interaction (HOI) term in the binary interaction part, which will lead to the modified GPE.

     With the HOI term, we need to be careful to apply the classical method, such as the normalized gradient flow method, to compute ground states. Specific techniques are needed to overcome the numerical difficulties, for example the stability issue, caused by the HOI term. In the talk, I will introduce two ways to compute ground states of BEC with HOI. One is the normalized gradient flow method with attractive-repulsive splitting. And the other one is to directly optimize the regularized density function formulation of the energy functional.
