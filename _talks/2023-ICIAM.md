Abstract: The binary interaction in Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is a big success in describing Bose-Einstein condensate, is typically chosen as Fermi contact interaction. However, in certain cases, higher order interaction (HOI) needs to be included. 

In the talk, I will show new phenomenon introduced by HOI, such as the non-Gaussian type approximations in dimension reduction problems，new types of Thomas-Fermi approximations. Besides, two algorithms for computing ground states, which overcome the stability issue, will be presented.
