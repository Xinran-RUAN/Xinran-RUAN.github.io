Welcome to my academic homepage. 
I am [Xinran RUAN](https://math.cnu.edu.cn/FACULTY/qtjs2/szmjs/R/3d23cacad76a494c98dd5011bfdaf226.htm), an associate professor in School of Mathematical Sciences, Capital Normal University, working on scientific computing and numerical analysis. 

My research interests lie in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on applications in cold atom systems and population dynamics in biology.
