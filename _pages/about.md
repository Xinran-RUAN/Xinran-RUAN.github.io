Welcome to my academic homepage. 
I am [Xinran RUAN](https://math.cnu.edu.cn/FACULTY/qtjs2/szmjs/R/3d23cacad76a494c98dd5011bfdaf226.htm), an associate professor in School of Mathematical Sciences, Capital Normal University. 


I received my B.S. degree from Peking University in 2012, and my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Prof. Weizhu Bao. After that, I held postdoctoral positions at the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL), Sorbonne University, under the supervision of Prof. Benoît Perthame, and at Politecnico di Torino, working with Prof. Tommaso Lorenzi. I joined Capital Normal University in 2021.

My research interests lie in the development and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on applications in cold atom systems and population dynamics in biology.
