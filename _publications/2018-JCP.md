Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the normalized gradient flow method
to compute the ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with higher
order interactions (HOI), which is modelled via the modified Gross-Pitaevskii
equation (MGPE). Schemes constructed in naive ways suﬀer from severe sta-
bility problems due to the high restrictions on time steps. To build an eﬃcient
and stable scheme, we split the HOI term into two parts with each part treated
separately. The part corresponding to a repulsive/positive energy is treated
semi-implicitly while the one corresponding to an attractive/negative energy is
treated fully explicitly. Based on the splitting, we construct the BEFD-splitting
and BESP-splitting schemes. A variety of numerical experiments shows that
the splitting will improve the stability of the schemes significantly. Besides, we
will show that the methods can be applied to multidimensional problems and
to the computation of the first excited state as well.
