Abstract: We consider a phenotype-structured reaction-diffusion model of avascular glioma growth. The model describes the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and oxygen, and takes into account anisotropic cell movement and oxygen diffusion related to structural anisotropy of the brainâ€™s extracellular environment. In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is captured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which evolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version of the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it admits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous travelling wavesolutions, where in the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies across the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a mathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour. We then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the results of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also demonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on tumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge. These results are complemented with additional results of 3D simulations, which are carried out on the geometry of the brain by using a hybrid finite difference-finite element method and integrating patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging data with diffusion tensor imaging data.
