Abstract: We propose an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme for a population model structured by age and a phenotypical trait with or without mutations. It has been proved that Dirac concentrations on particular phenotypical traits appear in the case without mutations, which makes the numerical resolution of the problem challenging. Inspired by its asymptotic behaviour, we apply a proper Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) representation of the solution to derive an A-P scheme, with which we can accurately capture the concentrations on a coarse, Îµ-independent mesh.
