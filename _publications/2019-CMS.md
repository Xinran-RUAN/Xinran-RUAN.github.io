Abstract: We study asymptotically and numerically the fundamental gap – the difference between the first two smallest (and distinct) eigenvalues – of the fractional Schro ̈dinger operator (FSO) and for- mulate a gap conjecture on the fundamental gap of the FSO. Based on the asymptotic and extensive numerical results, a gap conjecture on the fundamental gap of the FSO is formulated. Surprisingly, for two and higher dimensions, the lower bound of the fundamental gap depends not only on the diameter of the domain, but also the diameter of the largest inscribed ball of the domain, which is completely different from the case of the Schrodinger operator.
