The cell phenotypic state is described by a continuous structuring variable and the evolution of the local cell population density function (i.e. the cell phenotypic distribution at each spatial position) is governed by a non-local advection–reaction–diffusion equation. We report on the results of numerical simulations showing that, in the case where the cell mobility is bounded, compactly supported travelling fronts emerge. More mobile phenotypic variants occupy the front edge, whereas more proliferative phenotypic variants are selected at the back of the front. In order to explain such numerical results, we carry out formal asymptotic analysis of the model equation using a Hamilton–Jacobi approach. In summary, we show that the locally dominant phenotypic trait (i.e. the maximum point of the local cell population density function along the phenotypic dimension) satisfies a generalised Burgers’ equation with source term, we construct travelling-front solutions of such transport equation and characterise the corresponding minimal speed. Moreover, we show that, when the cell mobility is unbounded, front edge acceleration and formation of stretching fronts may occur. We briefly discuss the implications of our results in the context of glioma growth.},

We present explicit solutions for plane waves and linear excitations, and identify the differences in the theoretical predictions between the parabolic and non-parabolic mean-field models, showing the possibility of symmetry breaking in the latter. We then consider the evolution of wavepackets and show that self-localisation effects may be observed due to the curvature of the dispersion relation. Finally, we revisit the dynamics of dark soliton trains and show that additional localized density excitations may emerge in the dynamics due to the excitation of high frequency components, mimicking the appearance of near-bright solitary waves over short timescales.},

For the FSO on bounded domains with either the local fractional Laplacian or the classical fractional Laplacian, we obtain the fundamental gap of the FSO analytically on simple geometry without potential and numerically on complicated geometries and/or with different convex potentials. Based on the asymptotic and extensive numerical results, a gap conjecture on the fundamental gap of the FSO is formulated. Surprisingly, for two and higher dimensions, the lower bound of the fundamental gap depends not only on the diameter of the domain, but also the diameter of the largest inscribed ball of the domain, which is completely different from the case of the Schr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}dinger operator. Extensions of these results for the FSO in the whole space and on bounded domains with periodic boundary conditions are presented.},

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Existing comparative studies between individual-based models of growing cell populations and their continuum counterparts have mainly been focused on homogeneous populations, in which all cells have the same phenotypic characteristics. However, significant intercellular phenotypic variability is commonly observed in cellular systems. In light of these considerations, we develop here an individual-based model for the growth of phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations. In this model, the phenotypic state of each cell is described by a structuring variable that captures intercellular variability in cell proliferation and migration rates. The model tracks the spatial evolutionary dynamics of single cells, which undergo pressure-dependent proliferation, heritable phenotypic changes and directional movement in response to pressure differentials. We formally show that the continuum limit of this model comprises a non-local partial differential equation for the cell population density function, which generalises earlier models of growing cell populations. We report on the results of numerical simulations of the individual-based model which illustrate how proliferation-migration tradeoffs shaping the evolutionary dynamics of single cells can lead to the formation, at the population level, of travelling waves whereby highly-mobile cells locally dominate at the invasive front, while more-proliferative cells are found at the rear. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is an excellent quantitative agreement between these results and the results of numerical simulations and formal travelling-wave analysis of the continuum model, when sufficiently large cell numbers are considered. We also provide numerical evidence of scenarios in which the predictions of the two models may differ due to demographic stochasticity, which cannot be captured by the continuum model. This indicates the importance of integrating individual-based and continuum approaches when modelling the growth of phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
